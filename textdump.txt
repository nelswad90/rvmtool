	Value searched for: "The single-and dual-frequency ionosphere corrections in satellite altimetry are analyzed in detail. Taking Topex dual-frequency ionosphere corrections as an example, RMS of cross-over difference can be reduced upto 5.7-7.3 mm by along-track filtering of low-pass Gauss. Then, the filtered Topex ionosphere corrections are cross-calibrated with DOIRS, IRI2007 and GIM models that are established by measurements of global continuous GPS tracking stations. The results show that the accuracy of DORIS and GIM is higher than that of IRI2007. The statistics of difference between the filtered Topex dual-frequency ionosphere correction and that from these models show a systematic bias of 10-15 mm."

	Value searched for: "Extremely low frequency (ELF) propagation formulas for vertical electric dipole sources radiating in a spherical uniform earth-ionosphere cavity have been derived. These formulas have a range dependence characterized by either the Legendre function of the first kind of complex degree v and order zero or one of its first two derivatives. It is difficult to get the value of the Legendre function unless through appropriate approximations. In this paper, a new numerical integral method for the Legendre function is present. It is more efficient and accurate, and can be used in wider frequency band. The field excited vertical dipole at several frequencies are calculated through the numerical integral method. The fields calculated can image the physical phenomena of ELF propagation in earth-ionosphere cavity, and the frequencies of Schumem resonance is the same as previous researches. ©2012 by Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Radio Science."

	Value searched for: "Based on the international reference ionosphere (IRI) and the quasi-parabolic segments (QPS) model, a new ionosphere hybrid modeling method for short-wave ray tracing was proposed. The group ranges which show the short-wave propagation trace in the ionosphere were obtained separately by simulation in the hybrid model and the IRI model. By comparing the simulated results and the ionospheric oblique incidence sounding experimental data, the hybrid modeling method accuracy at mid-latitude region in China was analyzed. It indicates the ray tracing simulation accuracy in the hybrid model on experimental day better than the one in the IRI model. The limit to the QPS model's input is reduced by the hybrid modeling method and the QPS model's application range is extended in ray tracing technology."

	Value searched for: "An analysis with GPS data was conducted to identify the possible serious effects that special characteristics, including ionospheric anomaly, ionospheric storm and ionosphere scintillation existing in China area will have on system integrity and availability. The ionospheric anomaly could make the ionospheric delay less correlated to establish a reasonable threshold to bound ionospheric residual error. Breaking down the ionospheric correlation structure, an ionospheric storm will make it a more difficult work to derive an appropriate threshold and effective disturbance detection as well. Ionospheric scintillation could affect the system availability as it will cause errors in pseudo-range measurement, losing of available satellites under severe scintillation condition and finally an erroneous position fixing. Irregularity related to scintillation will also cause a bad estimation of TEC, resulting in difficulties in GNSS ionospheric correction model realization. All these effects often work on each other, making the things even worse. Copyright © 2012 by Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Radio Science."

At present, average dawn-dust electric field and projected electric field as convection electric field within magnetosphere are applied usually in space physics. In this paper, we adopted Weimer's electric field as the mode of ionospheric electric field. Then, we projected the ionospheric electric field to magnetospheric space along lines of magnetic force of T96, and got a new model of magnetospheric electric field. We also discussed the impact of magnetic storm, IMF, solar wind parameters, and suhstorm on magnetospheric electric field. The computing result of this model was consistent with the results detected by satellites."

However, the accuracy of these models may be limited due to complex phenomena and interactions occurring between the junctions of the solar cells and the nonlinear influence of charged particles. In this paper we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to estimate the EQE performance of triple-junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cells under the influence of a wide range of charged particles. Using the experimental data from Sato et al. . [1], it is shown that the ANN-based models provide a better estimate of the EQE than the PC1D model .

The three main disturbances associated with the charging are the acceleration noise of the test mass, the coupling between the test mass and the spacecraft, the appearance of unwanted coherent Fourier components in the measurement bandwidth. By implementing the same geometry and physics models in our previous work, a positive charging rate of 9369 e/s for the solar energetic particles (SEPs) event on October 19th 1989 is predicted. Based on these charging rates, we calculated the acceleration noise and stiffness associated with charging. We also compared the acceleration noises arising from Coulomb and Lorentz effects using different discharge characteristics. Although the noise due to charging exceeds the ASTROD I budget for the two events at 0.5 AU, it can be suppressed through continuous discharging. In addition to Monte Carlo uncertainty, an error of ±30% in the net charging rates was added to account for uncertainties in the primaries spectra, physics and geometry models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The result point to the fact that pre-storm phenomena that leads to intense ionospheric storm are; large southward turning of interplanetary magnetic field Bz, high electric field, increase in flow speed stream, increase in proton number density, high pressure ram and high plasma beta. The magnitude of Bz turning into southward direction from northward highly depends upon the severity of the storm and the variation in F2 layer parameter at the time of geomagnetic storm are strongly dependent upon the storm intensity. A detailed analysis of the responses of the ionosphere shows that during the storm periods, foF2 values depleted simultaneously both in the equatorial and mid latitude. Observation also shows that low to moderate variations in ionospheric F2 at the pre-storm period may signal the upcoming of large ionospheric disturbances at the main phase. The ionospheric F2response for low and mid latitude does not show any significant differences during the storm main phase and the pre-storm period. The ionospheric response during the pre-storm period is thought very puzzling. The period is observed to be depleted throughout with low-moderate effect across all the stations in the low and mid latitude. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

For parallelization of the MHD code, we use four different methods, that is, regular one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional domain decomposition methods and a cache-hit type of three-dimensional domain decomposition method. We found that the regular three-dimensional decomposition of the MHD model is suitable for the HA8000 system, and the cache-hit type of three-dimensional decomposition is suitable for SR16000/L2 systems.

The sudden brightening persisted as a plateau of Fe XIX intensity that endured more than 11 minutes. The Fe XIX emission at the rise and during the life of the plateau showed no evidence of significant bulk velocity flows, and hence cannot be attributed to chromospheric evaporation. However, the line width showed a significant broadening at the rise of the plateau, corresponding to nonthermal velocities of at least 89kms 
                        -1 due to reconnection outflows or turbulence. During the plateau He I, O V, and Si XII brightened at successively later times starting about 3.5 minutes after Fe XIX, which suggests that these brightenings were produced by thermal conduction from the plasma that produced the Fe XIX line emission; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that they were produced by a weak beam of nonthermal particles. We interpret an observed shortening of the O V wavelength for about 1.5 minutes toward the middle of the plateau to indicate new upward motions driven by the flare, as occurs during gentle chromospheric evaporation; relative to a quiescent interval shortly before the flare, the O V upward velocity was around -10kms

To this end we generate model light curves following two different approaches: (1) We employ the emission patterns of the slot and outer gap models in the field geometries of magnetospheres with different conductivity σ. (2) We define realistic trajectories of radiating particles in magnetospheres of different σ and compute their Lorentz factor under the influence of magnetospheric electric fields and curvature radiation-reaction; with these at hand we then calculate the emitted radiation intensity.

We study how the increasing twist affects the spindown rate of the star, finding that a dramatic increase in spindown occurs. Particularly spectacular are explosive events caused by the sudden opening of large amounts of overtwisted magnetic flux, which may be associated with the observed giant flares.

Interestingly, the rapid increase of the positive magnetic flux occurred only during the fastest rotation of the rotating sunspot, the bright loop-shaped structure, and the filament. During the sunspot rotation, the inverse S-shaped filament gradually formed in the EUV filament channel. The filament experienced two eruptions. In the first eruption, the filament rose quickly and then the filament loops carrying the cool and the hot material were seen to spiral counterclockwise into the sunspot. About 10 minutes later, the filament became active and finally erupted. The filament eruption was accompanied with a C-class flare and a halo coronal mass ejection. These results provide evidence that sunspot rotation plays an important role in the formation and eruption of the sigmoidal active-region filament. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

The unexpected, yet defining feature discovered by IBEX is a Ribbon that extends over the energy range from about 0.2 to 6keV. This Ribbon is superposed on a more uniform, globally distributed heliospheric neutral population. With some important exceptions, the focus of early IBEX studies has been on neutral atoms with energies greater than 0.5keV. With nearly three years of science observations, enough low-energy neutral atom measurements have been accumulated to extend IBEX observations to energies less than 0.5keV. Using the energy overlap of the sensors to identify and remove backgrounds, energy spectra over the entire IBEX energy range are produced. However, contributions by interstellar neutrals to the energy spectrum below 0.2keV may not be completely removed. Compared with spectra at higher energies, neutral atom spectra at lower energies do not vary much from location to location in the sky, including in the direction of the IBEX Ribbon. Neutral fluxes are used to show that low energy ions contribute approximately the same thermal pressure as higher energy ions in the heliosheath. However, contributions to the dynamic pressure are very high unless there is, for example, turbulence in the heliosheath with fluctuations of the order of 50-100kms

To this end, with fast Fourier transform we extract the short (&lt;3minutes) and long (&gt;3minutes) period components of the QPPs from time-space diagrams of the tube slices. We find that velocity differences did exist among the short/long-period components of different wavelengths, but only one event in the long-period ones showed they were greater than the measurement errors (e.g., 65kms

The average ratio of the excess peak flux to the pre-flare flux for the M-class flares is 5.5 %±3.7 % and that for the X-class flares is 16 %±11 %. The excess peak fluxes in two SEM bands are positively correlated with the X-ray flare class; with the increase in the X-ray flare class, the excess peak flux in two SEM bands increases. However, a large dispersion in the excess peak flux in the SEM bands and their ratio is found for the same X-ray flare class. The relationship between the excess peak fluxes of the two SEM bands also shows large dispersion.

The Doppler frequency shift measurements are supplemented with measurements of collocated Digisonde DPS-4D at SANSA Space Sciences, Hermanus. Nine geomagnetically quiet days and nine geomagnetically active days were included in the study. Waves of periods 4-30 min were observed during the daytime independent of the level of geomagnetic activity. Amplitudes of 10-30 min waves always increased between 14:00 and 16:15 UT (16:00-18:15 LT). Secondary maxima were observed between 06:00 and 07:00 UT (08:00-09:00 LT). The maximum wave amplitudes occurred close to the time of passage of the solar terminator in the studied region which is known to act as a source of gravity waves. Waves of periods 30-50 min were observed in the F2 layer during the daytime on five out of the eighteen days analysed, on four geomagnetically active days and on one quiet day. On the geomagnetically active day of 27 July 2010, waves of periods 1-2.5 min occurred in the evening and night hours. These waves appeared simultaneously with 1-2.5 min fluctuations of horizontal components of the local geomagnetic field.

Energetic particles can also escape to the corona and interplanetary medium, produce radio emissions (electrons) and may eventually reach the Earth's orbit.

Both parameters generally show better agreement with the IRI predictions during daytime than during nighttime.

In this paper, we address this deficiency by consolidating Mount Wilson Observatory polar faculae data from four data reduction campaigns, validating it through a comparison with facular data counted automatically from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) intensitygrams, and calibrating it against polar field measurements taken by the Wilcox Solar Observatory and average polar field and total polar flux calculated using MDI line-of-sight magnetograms. Our results show that the consolidated polar facular measurements are in excellent agreement with both polar field and polar flux estimates, making them an ideal proxy to study the evolution of the polar magnetic field. Additionally, we combine this database with sunspot area measurements to study the role of the polar magnetic flux in the evolution of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF). We find that there is a strong correlation between HMF and polar flux at solar minimum and that, taken together, polar flux and sunspot area are better at explaining the evolution of the HMF during the last century than sunspot area alone. © 2012.

During elevated auroral activity, the gradient, represented by the ratio of inner (eastward-observed) to outer (westward-observed) fluxes, exhibits undulations lasting 1-3 h. A superposed epoch analysis based on 85 geosynchronous field dipolarizations observed during 19 SEP events between 1998 and 2006 shows that &gt;4 MeV inner proton fluxes increase as the geosynchronous field stretches during substorm growth phase, then decrease gradually following field dipolarization at substorm onset. This behavior is distinct from the sharp increase of outer belt electrons and protons at the time of the dipolarization. The undulations indicate that substorm-related field changes in the near-Earth magnetotail enhance access of SEPs to the inner magnetosphere (down to L4). The observation of undulations at geosynchronous orbit is suppressed during high solar wind dynamic pressure (P 
                        dyn&gt;5 nPa) or strong geomagnetic storm conditions (Dst&lt;-100 nT) because the radial gradient is greatly reduced under these conditions and the interplanetary flux level provides an upper limit to the SEP fluxes in the magnetosphere. A sequence of 10 SEP undulations was observed during and following the 18 April 2002 sawtooth event. Analysis of this sequence shows that undulations observed at all local times are associated with substorm-related field changes on the nightside.

We apply an automated fitting scheme to field-aligned current densities provided by the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) and identify the latitude of maximum R1 current at all magnetic local times to yield the size of the R1 oval. We investigate the dynamics of the R1 oval size in response to geomagnetic activity for two cases corresponding to: repeated substorm activations with a minimally enhanced ring current; a significant ring current enhancement with multiple substorms. During the first event the dynamics of the R1 oval size reflected an expanding-contracting polar cap: during substorm growth phase dayside reconnection added open magnetic flux to the polar cap, expanding the R1 oval equatorward. Tail reconnection during the substorm expansion phase converted open into closed magnetic flux and the polar cap contracts as reflected by the poleward retreat of the R1 oval. During the period of enhanced ring current intensity the R1 oval grew to larger sizes during each substorm growth phase than it did during the other event, consistent with the suggestion that a stronger ring current stabilizes the magnetospheric tail to the onset of magnetic reconnection. The presented methodology allows AMPERE data to be condensed into a single parameter, the R1 oval size, which reflects magnetospheric dynamics and provides a convenient measure of the instantaneous magnetospheric system state in both hemispheres. © 2012.

This SAPS driven TIEGCM is used to simulate the effect of SAPS on the global thermosphere and ionosphere during a moderate geomagnetically active period between day of year (DOY) 329 and 333 in 2008. Model results show: (1) SAPS caused an increase in global thermospheric temperature which became stronger with time. This neutral temperature increase was more significant in subauroral and auroral regions. Joule heating by the SAPS and the redistribution of this heat by dynamic processes were the primary mechanisms for the simulated global neutral temperature changes. (2) In the SAPS driven TIEGCM, the strong ion drag effect in the subauroral SAPS channel drove large changes in thermospheric winds. Zonal neutral winds had either an extra, separate channel of westward flow in the subauroral region in the afternoon-midnight sector or a broad westward wind jet that merged with the regular duskside auroral westward zonal neutral wind driven by the high latitude convection pattern. The exact latitudinal profile of the zonal winds depended on local time. (3) The response of neutral temperature and wind to SAPS was more significant at higher altitudes and exhibited seasonal/hemispheric asymmetry. (4) The heating to the thermosphere by SAPS also resulted in changes in thermospheric composition with upwelling of molecular rich air in subauroral and auroral regions and downwelling of atomic oxygen rich air at other latitudes. These changes in thermospheric composition contributed to the deeper and more extended ionospheric electron density depletions in subauroral middle latitude regions, as well as electron density increases along the equatorward edge of the SAPS channel in the afternoon sector. © 2012.

The actual advance time of reliable forecasts (before the peak value is reached) is on average 5-6 hours, illustrating the realistic horizon of such "constant input" assumption.

Australia has many simultaneous observations from vertically orientated ionospheric sounders with spatial separations on the scale of 1000 km. However, with this spatial sampling only large scale ionospheric disturbances can be mapped and subsequently modeled. DSTO has an experimental program in progress to investigate the smaller spatial scale disturbances. These are often seen on vertical incidence soundings and are uncorrelated with soundings from greater than 500 km away. They can also be uncorrelated with soundings from the same site only 15 min later. The DSTO program to investigate these ionospheric disturbances is called SpICE, for Spatial Ionospheric Correlation Experiment. SpICE uses a small set of transmitters and receivers with varying separations to achieve a geographically spread set of near-vertical incidence ionospheric "reflection" points separated by 50-150 km, allowing us to probe disturbances at this spatial scale. Using the latest digital receiver technology we can collect amplitude and phase information from the ionospheric returns of the continuous wave transmissions of a nearby transmitter that is rapidly sweeping through the HF band. The returned signal is processed at a very high resolution to achieve good signal-to-noise complex ionograms at better than one-minute time updates. To date there have been three SpICE campaigns. This paper will discuss the SpICE program goals and highlight some of the unusual features observed in the first campaign.

	Value searched for: "This work concerns the problem of a whistler mode wave exit to the ground. After propagation in the magnetosphere a wave, in general, falls on the ionosphere with the angle of incidence outside the transmission cone. Such waves do not reach the Earth experiencing total internal reflection at the atmosphere-ionosphere boundary. To explain wave exit to the ground, we follow up on the idea of wave scattering on small-scale irregularities in the ionosphere. Interaction with these irregularities excites harmonics inside the transmission cone. Using the Green function method, we derive an integral equation for the wavefield containing all modes possible for a given frequency, solve this equation in the Born approximation, and obtain an expression for the energy flux of the waves which were scattered into the transmission cone. © 2012.

	Value searched for: "Several mechanisms including heat transport due to zonal winds, chemical heating and field-aligned ion drag have been proposed to explain the formation of the Equatorial Thermosphere Anomaly (ETA), but the cause of the ETA crests in thermosphere temperature is still a mystery. Our companion study (Lei et al., 2012) has revealed that the field-aligned ion drag mainly contributes to the ETA trough, but has little effect on the ETA crests. In this study, the mechanisms of heat transport associated with zonal winds and chemical heating due to recombination are examined to assess their contributions to the production of the ETA crests on the basis of National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (NCAR-TIEGCM) simulations. Our sensitivity simulations demonstrate that neither heat transport due to zonal winds nor chemical heating is able to explain the formation of the ETA crests. Instead, we found that the formation of the ETA crests is attributed to plasma-neutral heating which has two peaks in the topside ionosphere aside the magnetic equator. These two peaks, which are largely controlled by the magnetic field, are the results of energy transfer from thermal electrons and ions to the neutrals through collisions due to their temperature differences, albeit the ultimate source of this heating is solar radiation which produces photoelectrons that mainly depend on solar zenith angle. The TIEGCM simulations show that the crests of the ETA always locate poleward by 10-15 with respect to those of the Equatorial Ionosphere Anomaly (EIA), although the trough location of the ETA resembles that of the EIA. The location of the ETA crests is associated with the two-hump structure in plasma-neutral collision heating which is small inside the EIA region and larger at the poleward edge of this region. © 2012.

	Value searched for: "In order to improve model comparisons with recently improved incoherent scatter radar measurements at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory we have added photoelectron transport and energy redistribution to the two dimensional SAMI2 ionospheric model. The photoelectron model uses multiple pitch angle bins, includes effects associated with curved magnetic field lines, and uses an energy degradation procedure which conserves energy on coarse, non-uniformly spaced energy grids. The photoelectron model generates secondary electron production rates and thermal electron heating rates which are then passed to the fluid equations in SAMI2. We then compare electron and ion temperatures and electron densities of this modified SAMI2 model with measurements of these parameters over a range of altitudes from 90km to 1650km (L=1.26) over a 24 hour period. The new electron heating model is a significant improvement over the semi-empirical model used in SAMI2. The electron temperatures above the F-peak from the modified model qualitatively reproduce the shape of the measurements as functions of time and altitude and quantitatively agree with the measurements to within ∼30% or better during the entire day, including during the rapid temperature increase at dawn. © 2012.

	Value searched for: "The Saint Santin (45N) incoherent scatter radar data base shows a local enhancement in nighttime ion temperature that occurs in winter only. Its amplitude can exceed 100 K and averages 40 K on the basis of a conservative computation. The enhancement peaks near 4 LT and has a duration of about 4 hours. We discuss two possible explanations for this feature: (1) it is caused by the convergence of global winds at the global pressure minimum, under which Saint Santin rotates at winter solstice, and (2) it is an extension or propagation of the well-known low-latitude midnight temperature maximum to midlatitudes, perhaps to that pressure minimum. © 2012.

	Value searched for: "To explain the pulsed emission of the rotation powered pulsars from radio to gamma-ray, polar cap models, slot gap models, and outer gap models are proposed. Recent observations suggest that these models are likely to co-exist in the same magnetosphere. If so, their mutual relation is known to be troublesome (Harding 2009), due to the boundary conditions and the direction of the current, which are properly assumed in each acceleration model. We performed a particle simulation for the global magnetospheric structure. Based on this simulation, we present a new picture of the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere. It is found that a new dead zone is formed along the current neutral line that separates the oppositely directed current. We shall call this the current-neutral zone. We suggest that the polar cap accelerators and the slot gaps locate above the current-neutral zone, and the outer gap exist between the current neutral zone and the traditional dead zone. We also give an estimate of the super-rotation region.© 2012. Astronomical Society of Japan."

	Value searched for: "The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) provides high cadence and high resolution images of the structure and morphology of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere. CME directions and propagation speeds have often been estimated through the use of time-elongation maps obtained from the STEREO Heliospheric Imager (HI) data. Many of these CMEs have been identified by citizen scientists working within the SolarStormWatch project (www.solarstormwatch.com) as they work towards providing robust real-time identification of Earth-directed CMEs. The wide field of view of HI allows scientists to directly observe the two-dimensional (2D) structures, while the relative simplicity of time-elongation analysis means that it can be easily applied to many such events, thereby enabling a much deeper understanding of how CMEs evolve between the Sun and the Earth. For events with certain orientations, both the rear and front edges of the CME can be monitored at varying heliocentric distances (R) between the Sun and 1 AU. Here we take four example events with measurable position angle widths and identified by the citizen scientists. These events were chosen for the clarity of their structure within the HI cameras and their long track lengths in the time-elongation maps. We show a linear dependency with R for the growth of the radial width (W) and the 2D aspect ratio (χ) of these CMEs, which are measured out to ≈ 0.7 AU. We estimated the radial width from a linear best fit for the average of the four CMEs. We obtained the relationships W=0.14 R+0.04 for the width and χ=2.5 R+0.86 for the aspect ratio (W and R in units of AU). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

	Value searched for: "We investigate multi-spacecraft observations of the 17 January 2010 solar energetic particle event. Energetic electrons and protons have been observed over a remarkable large longitudinal range at the two STEREO spacecraft and SOHO, suggesting a longitudinal spread of nearly 360 degrees at 1 AU. The flaring active region, which was on the backside of the Sun as seen from Earth, was separated by more than 100 degrees in longitude from the magnetic footpoints of each of the three spacecraft. The event is characterized by strongly delayed energetic particle onsets with respect to the flare and only small or no anisotropies in the intensity measurements at all three locations. The presence of a coronal shock is evidenced by the observation of a type II radio burst from the Earth and STEREO-B. In order to describe the observations in terms of particle transport in the interplanetary medium, including perpendicular diffusion, a 1D model describing the propagation along a magnetic field line (model 1) (Dröge, Astrophys. J. 589, 1027 - 1039, 2003) and the 3D propagation model (model 2) by Dröge et al. (Astrophys. J. 709, 912 - 919, 2010) including perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary medium have been applied. While both models are capable of reproducing the observations, model 1 requires injection functions at the Sun of several hours. Model 2, which includes lateral transport in the solar wind, reveals high values for the ratio of perpendicular to parallel diffusion. Because we do not find evidence for unusual long injection functions at the Sun, we favor a scenario with strong perpendicular transport in the interplanetary medium as an explanation for the observations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

	Value searched for: "We analyze FUV spatially-resolved dayglow spectra obtained at 0.37. nm resolution by the UVIS instrument during the Cassini flyby of Venus. The intensities of the ultraviolet multiplets of carbon at 126.1, 156.1 and 165.7. nm are determined using a least squares fit technique applied to all dayglow spectra recorded by UVIS along the Cassini track. These intensities are compared with the results of a full radiative transfer model of these emissions, that includes the known photochemical sources of photons and resonant scattering of sunlight. The carbon density profile of the Venus thermosphere has never been directly measured and is taken from a model. We find a serious disagreement between these observations and modeling that can be accounted for by applying a scaling factor to the carbon column. This needed scaling factor is found to increase monotonically with solar zenith angle, suggesting a possible photochemical origin to the disagreement, possibly involving the photochemistry of molecular oxygen to which the carbon density is highly sensitive. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

	Value searched for: "The solar wind is filled with strong current sheets and sudden velocity shears; often the two are co-located. Sudden velocity shears at 1 AU are statistically analyzed using ACE measurements from 1998 to 2008. The occurrence rates of passage and the orientations of the shear planes are examined. For shear layers with vector velocity changes |v| > 50 km/s, an average of ∼12 pass the Earth per day. In the fast wind, ∼60 sudden shear layers pass the Earth per day (about 2.5 per hour). To explore the effects of sudden wind shears on the Earth's magnetosphere, global magnetospheric MHD simulations with four different simulation codes are performed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) with north-south and east-west wind shears. Windsock movement of the magnetotail is analyzed and comet-like disconnections of the magnetotail and magnetosheath are examined. Sudden changes in the cross-polar-cap potential and ionospheric Joule dissipation are seen as the shear layers pass the Earth. Other potential effects of sudden wind shear on the magnetosphere are discussed. © 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved."

	Value searched for: "The GOES X28 flare of 4 November 2003 was the largest ever recorded in its class. It produced the first evidence for two spectrally separated emission components, one at microwaves and the other in the THz range of frequencies. We analyzed the pre-flare phase of this large flare, twenty minutes before the onset of the major impulsive burst. This period is characterized by unusual activity in X-rays, sub-THz frequencies, H α, and microwaves. The CME onset occurred before the onset of the large burst by about 6 min. It was preceded by pulsations of 3 - 5 s periods at sub-THz frequencies together with X-ray and microwave enhancements. The sub-THz pulsations faded out as impulsive bursts were detected at 100 - 300 keV and 7 GHz, close to the time of the first Hα brightening and the CME onset. The activities detected prior to and at the CME onset were located nearly 2 arcmin south of the following large flare, suggesting they were separate events. This unusual activity brings new clues to understanding the complex energy buildup mechanisms prior to the CME onset, occurring at a distinct location and well before the major flare that exploded afterwards. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

To assess the value of human interaction, a validation of subjective flare probability forecasts was conducted and compared to the results obtained from the climatological look-up table used at SWPC. Probabilistic flare forecasts are evaluated using the Brier Skill Score, then discretized and entered into contingency tables from which a variety of verification measures are calculated. The ultimate goal of this report is to provide an operational baseline, whereby the scores and statistics from this paper can be used as the basis for future evaluation of models presented to the operational community. © 2012.

	Value searched for: "Various longitudinal wave patterns exist in the low-latitude ionosphere, but the investigation has been limited to the wave number (WN) 3 and 4 patterns. This study extends the investigation to the wave patterns that have not yet been explored. The persistent ionospheric wave patterns are investigated by using the measurements of the ion density during March 1999-June 2004 by the first Republic of China satellite. The investigation is performed with data sets in the magnetic south (20S-0) and magnetic north (0-20N). The dominant wave features in plasma density are the WN1, WN2, WN3, and WN4 patterns. Among them, the WN1 pattern in the magnetic south during the June solstice is the most pronounced feature. Except for this component, the WN3 pattern is the most persistent and pronounced feature. Fundamental difference exists between the WN1 and WN2 patterns and the WN3 and WN4 patterns. First, the wave phases in the south and north are the same in the WN3 and WN4 patterns, but they are opposite in the WN1 and WN2 patterns. Second, the amplitudes of the WN3 and WN4 patterns show similar annual variation in the south and north, but those of the WN1 and WN2 patterns show opposite annual trends in the opposite hemispheres. These observations indicate that the WN1 and WN2 patterns and the WN3 and WN4 patterns are created by different mechanisms. We discuss the creation of the WN1 and WN2 patterns in association with the geomagnetic field configuration. © 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved."

	Value searched for: "During June 16-21, 2010, an Earth-directed coronal mass ejection (CME) event was observed by instruments onboard STEREO, SOHO, MESSENGER and Wind. This event was the first direct detection of a rotating CME in the middle and outer corona. Here, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the CME in the interplanetary medium comparing in situ and remote observations, with analytical models and three-dimensional reconstructions. In particular, we investigate the parallel and perpendicular cross section expansion of the CME from the corona through the heliosphere up to 1 AU. We use height-time measurements and the Gradual Cylindrical Shell (GCS) technique to model the imaging observations, remove the projection effects, and derive the 3-dimensional extent of the event. Then, we compare the results with in situ analytical Magnetic Cloud (MC) models, and with geometrical predictions from past works. We find that the parallel (along the propagation plane) cross section expansion agrees well with the in situ model and with the Bothmer and Schwenn (1998) empirical relationship based on in situ observations between 0.3 and 1 AU. Our results effectively extend this empirical relationship to about 5 solar radii. The expansion of the perpendicular diameter agrees very well with the in situ results at MESSENGER (∼0.5 AU) but not at 1 AU. We also find a slightly different, from Bothmer and Schwenn (1998), empirical relationship for the perpendicular expansion. More importantly, we find no evidence that the CME undergoes a significant latitudinal over-expansion as it is commonly assumed. Instead, we find evidence that effects due to CME rotation and expansion can be easily confused in the images leading to a severe overestimation of the proper 3D size of the event. Finally, we find that the reconstructions of the CME morphology from the in situ observations at 1 AU are in agreement with the remote sensing observations but they show a big discrepancy at MESSENGER. We attribute this discrepancy to the ambiguity of selecting the proper boundaries due to the lack of accompanying plasma measurements. © 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved."
